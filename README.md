# 🏦 Banking Management System

This Java-based console application allows users to manage bank accounts efficiently. It provides features such as account creation, deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry while demonstrating key Java concepts like Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Exception Handling, and Collections.([github.com][1])

## 🚀 Features

* *User Account Creation* – Create a new bank account with a unique account number.
* *Deposit Money* – Add money to an account with validation checks.
* *Withdraw Money* – Withdraw funds while ensuring sufficient balance.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* *Java SE (Core Java)* – For implementing the backend logic and user interaction.
* *Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)* – Encapsulation, Abstraction
* *Collections Framework* – HashMap for storing accounts
* *Exception Handling* – Ensuring valid transactions([kashipara.com][2], [github.com][1])
