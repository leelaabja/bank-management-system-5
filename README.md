# Banking Management System

This is a Python-based banking management system that allows users to perform basic banking operations such as account creation, balance checking, money withdrawal, and deposit. The system ensures secure access through password protection and utilizes MySQL for data storage.([github.com][1])

## Instructions to Run the Program

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x or higher
* MySQL
* MySQL Connector for Python([github.com][1], [geeksforgeeks.org][2], [github.com][3])

### Steps

1. *Clone the Repository:*

   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Banking-Management-System.git
   cd Banking-Management-System
   



2. *Install Dependencies:*

   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   



3. *Set Up MySQL Database:*

   sql
   CREATE DATABASE bank;
   USE bank;

   CREATE TABLE customers (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(255),
       address VARCHAR(255),
       balance DECIMAL(10, 2)
   );

   CREATE TABLE transactions (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       customer_id INT,
       amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
       type ENUM('deposit', 'withdrawal'),
       date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
       FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(id)
   );
   



4. *Running the Program:*

   bash
   python src/main.py
   



The program will prompt you to log in or create a new account. Once logged in, you can perform various banking operations.

## Technologies Used

* Python: For implementing the backend logic and user interaction.
* MySQL: For storing user data and account transactions securely.
* getpass: For handling password inputs securely.([github.com][1])

## Future Scope

* *Enhanced Security:* Implement multi-factor authentication for added security.
* *Web Interface:* Develop a web-based interface using Flask or Django for easier access.
* *Mobile Application:* Create a mobile application for users to manage their accounts on the go.
* *Advanced Features:* Introduce features like loan management, credit card services, and investment options.
